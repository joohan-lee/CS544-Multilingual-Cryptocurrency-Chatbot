Supply chains from Asian markets to the Western consumers has been seriously affected but the impact (like a deep sea earthquake) is a distant swell yet to hit landfall.  I'm expecting the financial impact of government shutdown of factories to occur in 2\\u20133 months, when delays and shortages push wholesale prices through the roof.  This may cause a significant correction in the stock markets worldwide, which in the short term may cause a dip in BTC price. If this occurs around May '20 (halving), there may be a steep correction.  But as was noted during the US assassination of Soleimani in January, BTC price rallied after the event, despite global fears of the act triggering another regional war.  \n"
